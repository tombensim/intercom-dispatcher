Build an app for the Intercom Messenger
=================

[**Follow the steps here in order to get your app up and running.**](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/build-your-first-messenger-app)

Once this is done, you can click `Show` in the header to view the live version of the app. For now it will only contain some URLs which you will need when creating the app in Intercom.

We will make a simple app which lets you add a button component to the Messenger. You can then use this to add in more functionality and start tinkering with the full potential of Intercom apps, in order to better understand how they can be used for your unique use cases.

**Glitch** lets us create a publicly available webservice where you can test and interact with your app. However, you can use any service you like when creating your app. This is one version we think is easy for getting started but feel free to use whatever you are most confortable with.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
